<span class="s0"># This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system</span>
<span class="s0"># doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project</span>
<span class="s0">#</span>
<span class="s0"># All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored</span>
<span class="s0"># The format is:</span>
<span class="s0">#       TAG = value [value, ...]</span>
<span class="s0"># For lists items can also be appended using:</span>
<span class="s0">#       TAG += value [value, ...]</span>
<span class="s0"># Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (&quot; &quot;)</span>

<span class="s0">#---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="s0"># Project related configuration options</span>
<span class="s0">#---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0"># This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file </span>
<span class="s0"># that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all </span>
<span class="s0"># text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the </span>
<span class="s0"># iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See </span>
<span class="s0"># http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.</span>

<span class="s0">DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8</span>

<span class="s0"># The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded </span>
<span class="s0"># by quotes) that should identify the project.</span>

<span class="s0">PROJECT_NAME           = Panda3D</span>

<span class="s0"># The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. </span>
<span class="s0"># This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or </span>
<span class="s0"># if some version control system is used.</span>

<span class="s0">PROJECT_NUMBER         = $(PANDA3D_VERSION)</span>

<span class="s0"># Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description</span>
<span class="s0"># for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer</span>
<span class="s0"># a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.</span>

<span class="s0">PROJECT_BRIEF          = </span>

<span class="s0"># With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is </span>
<span class="s0"># included in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not </span>
<span class="s0"># exceed 55 pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. </span>
<span class="s0"># Doxygen will copy the logo to the output directory.</span>

<span class="s0">PROJECT_LOGO           = </span>

<span class="s0"># The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) </span>
<span class="s0"># base path where the generated documentation will be put. </span>
<span class="s0"># If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location </span>
<span class="s0"># where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.</span>

<span class="s0">OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = reference-python</span>

<span class="s0"># If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create </span>
<span class="s0"># 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output </span>
<span class="s0"># format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. </span>
<span class="s0"># Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of </span>
<span class="s0"># source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would </span>
<span class="s0"># otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.</span>

<span class="s0">CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all </span>
<span class="s0"># documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this </span>
<span class="s0"># information to generate all constant output in the proper language. </span>
<span class="s0"># The default language is English, other supported languages are: </span>
<span class="s0"># Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, </span>
<span class="s0"># Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, </span>
<span class="s0"># Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English </span>
<span class="s0"># messages), Korean, Korean-en, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Macedonian, Persian, </span>
<span class="s0"># Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, </span>
<span class="s0"># Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.</span>

<span class="s0">OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English</span>

<span class="s0"># If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will </span>
<span class="s0"># include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in </span>
<span class="s0"># the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). </span>
<span class="s0"># Set to NO to disable this.</span>

<span class="s0">BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend </span>
<span class="s0"># the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. </span>
<span class="s0"># Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the </span>
<span class="s0"># brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.</span>

<span class="s0">REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator </span>
<span class="s0"># that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string </span>
<span class="s0"># in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be </span>
<span class="s0"># stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is </span>
<span class="s0"># used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. </span>
<span class="s0"># If left blank, the following values are used (&quot;$name&quot; is automatically </span>
<span class="s0"># replaced with the name of the entity): &quot;The $name class&quot; &quot;The $name widget&quot; </span>
<span class="s0"># &quot;The $name file&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;provides&quot; &quot;specifies&quot; &quot;contains&quot; </span>
<span class="s0"># &quot;represents&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;an&quot; &quot;the&quot;</span>

<span class="s0">ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       = &quot;The $name class&quot; \</span>
                         <span class="s0">&quot;The $name widget&quot; \</span>
                         <span class="s0">&quot;The $name file&quot; \</span>
                         <span class="s0">is \</span>

                         <span class="s0">the</span>

<span class="s0"># If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then </span>
<span class="s0"># Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief </span>
<span class="s0"># description.</span>

<span class="s0">ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all </span>
<span class="s0"># inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those </span>
<span class="s0"># members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment </span>
<span class="s0"># operators of the base classes will not be shown.</span>

<span class="s0">INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full </span>
<span class="s0"># path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set </span>
<span class="s0"># to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.</span>

<span class="s0">FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag </span>
<span class="s0"># can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is </span>
<span class="s0"># only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of </span>
<span class="s0"># the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list. </span>
<span class="s0"># If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the </span>
<span class="s0"># path to strip.</span>

<span class="s0">STRIP_FROM_PATH        = </span>

<span class="s0"># The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of </span>
<span class="s0"># the path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells </span>
<span class="s0"># the reader which header file to include in order to use a class. </span>
<span class="s0"># If left blank only the name of the header file containing the class </span>
<span class="s0"># definition is used. Otherwise one should specify the include paths that </span>
<span class="s0"># are normally passed to the compiler using the -I flag.</span>

<span class="s0">STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = </span>

<span class="s0"># If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter </span>
<span class="s0"># (but less readable) file names. This can be useful if your file system </span>
<span class="s0"># doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.</span>

<span class="s0">SHORT_NAMES            = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen </span>
<span class="s0"># will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style </span>
<span class="s0"># comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc </span>
<span class="s0"># comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments </span>
<span class="s0"># (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)</span>

<span class="s0">JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen will </span>
<span class="s0"># interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style </span>
<span class="s0"># comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the comments </span>
<span class="s0"># will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus requiring </span>
<span class="s0"># an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)</span>

<span class="s0">QT_AUTOBRIEF           = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen </span>
<span class="s0"># treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// </span>
<span class="s0"># comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. </span>
<span class="s0"># The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed </span>
<span class="s0"># description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead.</span>

<span class="s0">MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented </span>
<span class="s0"># member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it </span>
<span class="s0"># re-implements.</span>

<span class="s0">INHERIT_DOCS           = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES, then doxygen will produce </span>
<span class="s0"># a new page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will </span>
<span class="s0"># be part of the file/class/namespace that contains it.</span>

<span class="s0">SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. </span>
<span class="s0"># Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.</span>

<span class="s0">TAB_SIZE               = 4</span>

<span class="s0"># This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts </span>
<span class="s0"># as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form &quot;name=value&quot;. </span>
<span class="s0"># For example adding &quot;sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n&quot; will allow you to </span>
<span class="s0"># put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which </span>
<span class="s0"># will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading &quot;Side Effects:&quot;. </span>
<span class="s0"># You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.</span>

<span class="s0">ALIASES                = </span>

<span class="s0"># Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C </span>
<span class="s0"># sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. </span>
<span class="s0"># For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list </span>
<span class="s0"># of all members will be omitted, etc.</span>

<span class="s0">OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java </span>
<span class="s0"># sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for </span>
<span class="s0"># Java. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified </span>
<span class="s0"># scopes will look different, etc.</span>

<span class="s0">OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># Set the OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN tag to YES if your project consists of Fortran </span>
<span class="s0"># sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for </span>
<span class="s0"># Fortran.</span>

<span class="s0">OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN   = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL tag to YES if your project consists of VHDL </span>
<span class="s0"># sources. Doxygen will then generate output that is tailored for </span>
<span class="s0"># VHDL.</span>

<span class="s0">OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL   = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it </span>
<span class="s0"># parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension. </span>
<span class="s0"># Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this </span>
<span class="s0"># tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language </span>
<span class="s0"># is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C, </span>
<span class="s0"># C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make </span>
<span class="s0"># doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C </span>
<span class="s0"># (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions </span>
<span class="s0"># you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.</span>

<span class="s0">EXTENSION_MAPPING      = </span>

<span class="s0"># If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want </span>
<span class="s0"># to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should </span>
<span class="s0"># set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and </span>
<span class="s0"># definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string); v.s. </span>
<span class="s0"># func(std::string) {}). This also makes the inheritance and collaboration </span>
<span class="s0"># diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.</span>

<span class="s0">BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If you use Microsoft's C++/CLI language, you should set this option to YES to </span>
<span class="s0"># enable parsing support.</span>

<span class="s0">CPP_CLI_SUPPORT        = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># Set the SIP_SUPPORT tag to YES if your project consists of sip sources only. </span>
<span class="s0"># Doxygen will parse them like normal C++ but will assume all classes use public </span>
<span class="s0"># instead of private inheritance when no explicit protection keyword is present.</span>

<span class="s0">SIP_SUPPORT            = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># For Microsoft's IDL there are propget and propput attributes to indicate getter </span>
<span class="s0"># and setter methods for a property. Setting this option to YES (the default) </span>
<span class="s0"># will make doxygen replace the get and set methods by a property in the </span>
<span class="s0"># documentation. This will only work if the methods are indeed getting or </span>
<span class="s0"># setting a simple type. If this is not the case, or you want to show the </span>
<span class="s0"># methods anyway, you should set this option to NO.</span>

<span class="s0">IDL_PROPERTY_SUPPORT   = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC </span>
<span class="s0"># tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first </span>
<span class="s0"># member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default </span>
<span class="s0"># all members of a group must be documented explicitly.</span>

<span class="s0">DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES (the default) to allow class member groups of </span>
<span class="s0"># the same type (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a </span>
<span class="s0"># subgroup of that type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to </span>
<span class="s0"># NO to prevent subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using </span>
<span class="s0"># the \nosubgrouping command.</span>

<span class="s0">SUBGROUPING            = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum </span>
<span class="s0"># is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So </span>
<span class="s0"># typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct </span>
<span class="s0"># with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file, </span>
<span class="s0"># namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically </span>
<span class="s0"># be useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound </span>
<span class="s0"># types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.</span>

<span class="s0">TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># The SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the internal cache use to </span>
<span class="s0"># determine which symbols to keep in memory and which to flush to disk. </span>
<span class="s0"># When the cache is full, less often used symbols will be written to disk. </span>
<span class="s0"># For small to medium size projects (&lt;1000 input files) the default value is </span>
<span class="s0"># probably good enough. For larger projects a too small cache size can cause </span>
<span class="s0"># doxygen to be busy swapping symbols to and from disk most of the time </span>
<span class="s0"># causing a significant performance penalty. </span>
<span class="s0"># If the system has enough physical memory increasing the cache will improve the </span>
<span class="s0"># performance by keeping more symbols in memory. Note that the value works on </span>
<span class="s0"># a logarithmic scale so increasing the size by one will roughly double the </span>
<span class="s0"># memory usage. The cache size is given by this formula: </span>
<span class="s0"># 2^(16+SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range is 0..9, the default is 0, </span>
<span class="s0"># corresponding to a cache size of 2^16 = 65536 symbols</span>

<span class="s0">SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE      = 0</span>

<span class="s0"># If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in </span>
<span class="s0"># documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. </span>
<span class="s0"># Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless </span>

<span class="s0"># If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) </span>

<span class="s0"># If set to NO only classes defined in header files are included.</span>

<span class="s0">EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES</span>

<span class="s0"># This flag is only useful for Objective-C code. When set to YES local </span>

<span class="s0">EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be </span>
<span class="s0"># extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called </span>
<span class="s0"># 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base </span>
<span class="s0"># name of the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default </span>
<span class="s0"># anonymous namespaces are hidden.</span>

<span class="s0">EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all </span>
<span class="s0"># undocumented members of documented classes, files or namespaces. </span>
<span class="s0"># If set to NO (the default) these members will be included in the </span>

<span class="s0">HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = NO</span>

<span class="s0"># If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all </span>
