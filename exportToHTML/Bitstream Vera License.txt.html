<span class="s0">Copyright FAQ</span>
<span class="s0">=============</span>

   <span class="s0">1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?</span>

      <span class="s0">Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its</span>
      <span class="s0">competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system</span>
      <span class="s0">and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money</span>
      <span class="s0">from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to</span>
      <span class="s0">do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,</span>
      <span class="s0">however.</span>

   <span class="s0">2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and</span>
      <span class="s0">sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?</span>

      <span class="s0">Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a &quot;larger software package&quot; to begin </span>
      <span class="s0">with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. </span>
      <span class="s0">See 1. above.</span>

   <span class="s0">3. Are derivative works allowed?</span>
      <span class="s0">Yes!</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?</span>
      <span class="s0">Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?</span>

      <span class="s0">You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the</span>
      <span class="s0">quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to</span>
      <span class="s0">ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these</span>
      <span class="s0">names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,</span>
      <span class="s0">substitutions could still could have occurred during font</span>
      <span class="s0">opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional</span>
      <span class="s0">copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!</span>

   <span class="s0">6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get </span>
       <span class="s0">adopted in future versions?</span>

      <span class="s0">Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has</span>
      <span class="s0">provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to</span>
      <span class="s0">the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such</span>
      <span class="s0">additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the</span>
      <span class="s0">entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep</span>
      <span class="s0">both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add</span>
      <span class="s0">glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's</span>
      <span class="s0">design. Vera cannot become a &quot;ransom note&quot; font. Jim Lyles will be</span>
      <span class="s0">providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a</span>
      <span class="s0">guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?</span>

      <span class="s0">Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software</span>
      <span class="s0">with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. If applications have built the names &quot;Bitstream Vera&quot; into them, </span>
      <span class="s0">can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?</span>

      <span class="s0">This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source</span>
      <span class="s0">systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to</span>
      <span class="s0">use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,</span>
      <span class="s0">selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font</span>
      <span class="s0">names and substituting alternatives. An example is provided by the</span>
      <span class="s0">supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for</span>
      <span class="s0">&quot;sans&quot;, &quot;serif&quot; and &quot;monospace&quot;.  Other software (e.g., the XFree86</span>
      <span class="s0">core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.</span></pre>
